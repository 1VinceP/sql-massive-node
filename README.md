# Project Summary

In this project, we are going to make our first full CRUD back-end that uses a database.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step. we are going to create a bare-bones server.

### Instructions

* Run `npm init -y`.
* Use npm to install and save `express`, `bodyParser`, `cors`, and `massive`.
* Create a `.gitignore` to ignore the `node_modules` folder.
* Create an `index.js` file.
* Require all the packages that we installed and saved.
* Get your server listening on port `3000`.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> .gitignore </code> </summary>

```
node_modules
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const massive = require('massive');

const app = express();

const port = 3000;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}.`); } );
```

</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we are going to add massive to the server so we can connect to a database.

### Instructions

* Create a `connectionString` variable that connects to the `sanbox` database. ( This database was created when following the mini earlier today ).
* Use `massive` and the `connectionString` to establish a connection.
* In the `.then` callback from `massive`, set `db` on app to equal the database instance.

## Understand your data

We are going to be working with a single table, products.  It's schema will look something like this:

* ID : Primary key number
* Name : string
* Description: string
* Price: number
* Imageurl : string

## Create your .sql files

* Create a folder called db and place 5 files in there:
  * create_product
  * read_products
  * read_product
  * update_product
  * delete_product
  
* Create a working SQL query for each one.  You can use pgAdmin to test your queries against the database.

__create_product__

This query will need to take the 4 parameters defined in the schema and insert a record into the database.

__read_products__

This query will get all products in the table and return only the name, price, and image url

__read_product__

This query will take in an id and return all data for that product

__update_product__

This query will take in an id and a new description.  Find the product with the id and update it's description with the new description.

__delete_product__

This query will take in an id.  Find and delete the product with the id.


## Run your queries in your controller

* Create a productsCtrl.js
    * Export an object with 5 functions
        * Create, GetOne, GetAll, Update, Delete
    * Inside of each function, access the database instance by using `req.app.get('db')`.
    * Inside of Create use the create_product query
    * Inside of GetAll use the read_products query
    * Inside of GetOne, use the read_product query
    * Inside of Update, use the update_product query
    * Inside of Delete, use the delete_product query
    

## Create endpoints

* Create some endpoints on express.  Create one for each query type.

__Sample Urls__

`GET  /api/products`
`GET  /api/product/:productId`
`PUT  /api/product/:productId?desc=....`
`POST /api/product`
`DELETE /api/product/:productId`

## Wire your endpoints up to your controller

* use the syntax `app.get('/path/to/my/endpoint, controller.methodName)`.

## Test

* You should have a working crud app.  Use postman to insert a few records, modify them, query them, and delete them to make sure it's all working.

## Black Diamond

* Create an angular front end to interact with your app.
* Use express static to serve up your angular files from a public folder
* Create a single view that can insert, read, update, and delete products.
* Create a 2nd page that just reads the products and displays them in a more pretty way (like Jane.com or amazon).
